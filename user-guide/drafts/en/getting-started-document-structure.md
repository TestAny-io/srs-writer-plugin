# Understand the Generated Files

> **Goal**: Know what each file does, where it lives, and how they work together

## Overview

For each new project, SRS Writer creates a folder under your workspace root with these files:

```
<workspace>/<projectName>/
├── SRS.md                  # Human-readable requirements (Markdown)
├── requirements.yaml       # Structured requirements with IDs and relations
└── prototype/              # Prototype scaffold (HTML/CSS/JS)
    ├── index.html
    ├── theme.css
    └── interactions.js

.session-log/               # At workspace root (do not edit manually)
└── srs-writer-session_*.json
```

## 📄 SRS.md (main document)

- **Format**: Markdown, chapters come from `.templates/`, aligned with IEEE 830 conventions  
- **Coverage**: summary, overall description, journeys/use cases, FRs, NFRs, interfaces/data (IFR/DAR), risks/constraints, prototype overview, etc.  
- **IDs & traceability**: entity IDs (FR-001, NFR-001, UC-001, …) appear here and match `requirements.yaml`  
- **Quality**: `srs_reviewer` shares improvements in chat and may apply fixes directly

> Read and review in VS Code; export via Markdown extensions or copy to PDF when needed.

## 📊 requirements.yaml (structured requirements)

- **Purpose**: Machine-readable mirror of the same requirements—supports traceability, diffing, and automated checks  
- **Key fields** (example):
  ```yaml
  functionalRequirements:
    - id: FR-001
      title: User Authentication
      description: Users must be able to register/login
      priority: High
      status: Draft
      relatedTo:
        - type: derives_from
          id: UC-001   # linked use case
  nonFunctionalRequirements:
    - id: NFR-001
      category: Performance
      requirement: 95% requests < 500ms
  interfaceRequirements:
    - id: IFR-001
      api: POST /api/tasks
  dataRequirements:
    - id: DAR-001
      entity: Task
      fields:
        - name: title
          type: string
          required: true
  ```
- **Validation**: `syntaxChecker` supports basic/standard/strict; schema at `config/schemas/requirement-entity-schemas.yaml`
- **Editing**: Keep IDs stable; prefer asking SRS Writer to update via YAML edit tools rather than heavy manual edits

---

## 🎨 prototype/ (UI scaffold)

- Minimal `index.html` / `theme.css` / `interactions.js`
- Generated by the `prototype_designer` specialist to share UI ideas quickly
- Open directly in VS Code and extend styling/behavior as needed

---

## 🗂️ .session-log/ (session files)

- Location: workspace root, not inside the project folder
- Purpose: tracks current session, project switching, and sync status
- Note: do not edit manually; use Control Panel → Project Management for rename/delete operations

## How the files work together

- `SRS.md` is for humans; `requirements.yaml` is for tools—IDs and content stay in sync.
- Changes use the semantic editor: SID targeting for Markdown and key-path edits for YAML to avoid collateral changes.
- Quality review (`srs_reviewer`) feedback appears in chat and may patch `SRS.md`/`requirements.yaml` directly.

---

## Safe editing tips

- **Add/change requirements**: describe the change in chat and let SRS Writer apply it; avoid large manual edits.
- **Keep IDs stable**: FR/NFR/IFR/DAR/UC IDs anchor traceability—avoid renumbering.
- **Inspect diffs**: use VS Code SCM or `git diff` to confirm changes before committing.
