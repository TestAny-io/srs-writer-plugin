## Self-serve first

- 📖 **User Guide**: this documentation set (installation, scenarios, FAQs).  
- 🔍 **Search GitHub Issues**: https://github.com/Testany-io/srs-writer-plugin/issues  
  - Search open and closed issues  
  - Use error keywords (e.g., “No AI model available”)

---

## Ask the community (GitHub Discussions)

- Link: https://github.com/Testany-io/srs-writer-plugin/discussions  
- Use `Q&A` to ask, `Show and Tell` to share, `Ideas` for feature requests.  
- When asking:
  1. State the goal/problem briefly  
  2. Include environment: VS Code version, SRS Writer 0.8.2, OS, Copilot sign-in status  
  3. Provide repro steps or sample command/file path  
  4. Paste key errors (chat panel or Developer Tools Console)

## Report a bug (GitHub Issues)

- Create an issue: https://github.com/Testany-io/srs-writer-plugin/issues/new/choose  
- Include:
  - Environment: VS Code version, SRS Writer 0.8.2, OS, Copilot signed in?  
  - Repro steps (short and precise)  
  - Expected vs actual result  
  - Full error/logs (`Help` → `Toggle Developer Tools` → Console)

## Need to triage quickly?

- Run **Sync Status Check** in the Control Panel; if still off, try **Force Sync Context**.  
- Search the exact error text in Issues/Discussions; a fix often exists.  
- If blocked, open an Issue with steps, logs, and version details.
