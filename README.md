    style D fill:#92400e,stroke:#d97706,stroke-width:2px,color:#ffffff
```

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Technology |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Orchestrator** | Intent understanding and routing | AI + Natural Language Processing |
| **AST Parser** | Document structure analysis | marked.js + Custom parsing |
| **Strategy Engine** | Task execution and coordination | TypeScript + Async patterns |
| **Session Manager** | State persistence and context | File-based storage + Caching |
| **File System** | Document generation and management | VSCode APIs + Async I/O |

### Why This Architecture Matters

- **🚀 Performance**: Async operations keep VSCode responsive
- **🛡️ Reliability**: Graceful fallbacks ensure consistent operation
- **🔧 Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns and dependency injection
- **📈 Scalability**: Modular design supports growing feature sets
- **🎯 Accuracy**: AST-based parsing handles format variations robustly
