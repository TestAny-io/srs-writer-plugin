## Assumptions, Dependencies, and Constraints

### Assumptions

*Assumptions are conditions or events that are believed to be true but have not been verified. These should be validated as the project progresses.*

#### ADC-ASSU-001: Stakeholder Availability  
    - **Assumption**: Key business stakeholders will be available for requirements validation and user acceptance testing throughout the project lifecycle
    - **Affected Requirements**: [US-REGISTER-001, UC-LOGIN-002]
    - **Impact if False**: Requirements validation delays, potential scope changes
    - **Validation Method**: Confirmed stakeholder commitment and calendar availability
    - **Validation Date**: [Date]
    - **Owner**: [Business Sponsor]

#### ADC-ASSU-002: Budget Stability
    - **Assumption**: Project budget will remain stable throughout the project duration
    - **Affected Requirements**: [US-REGISTER-001, UC-LOGIN-002]
    - **Impact if False**: Scope reduction, timeline extension, or project cancellation
    - **Validation Method**: Quarterly budget reviews with finance team
    - **Validation Date**: [Ongoing]
    - **Owner**: [Project Sponsor]

#### ADC-ASSU-003: Technology Platform Stability  
    - **Assumption**: Current technology platform will remain supported and stable
    - **Affected Requirements**: [US-REGISTER-001, US-TOPUP-003, UC-LOGIN-002]
    - **Impact if False**: Platform migration required, additional development effort
    - **Validation Method**: Vendor roadmap review and support agreement verification
    - **Validation Date**: [Date]
    - **Owner**: [Technical Architect]

#### ADC-ASSU-004: Team Availability  
    - **Assumption**: Required technical resources with appropriate skills will be available when needed
    - **Affected Requirements**: [US-BILL-004, US-ORDER-006, UC-PAYMENT-005]
    - **Impact if False**: Project delays, quality issues, budget overruns
    - **Validation Method**: Resource allocation confirmation and skills assessment
    - **Validation Date**: [Date]
    - **Owner**: [Resource Manager]

### Dependencies

*Dependencies are external factors upon which the project's success depends but are outside the direct control of the project team.*

#### ADC-DEPEN-001: Third-Party System Upgrades  
    - **Dependency**: [System Name] must be upgraded to version [X.X] to support required API integration
    - **Affected Requirements**: [US-REGISTER-001, US-ORDER-006, UC-CART-005]
    - **Impact**: Integration functionality cannot be implemented until upgrade is complete
    - **Risk Level**: High
    - **Mitigation Strategy**: Coordinate with [System Owner] to prioritize upgrade, develop contingency plan
    - **Target Completion**: [Date]
    - **Owner**: [External System Owner]
    - **Status**: [In Progress/Pending/Complete]

### Constraints

*Constraints are limitations that restrict the project's options and must be accommodated in the solution design.*

#### ADC-CONST-002: Technology Platform Limitations  
    - **Constraint**: Solution must operate within existing [Platform Name] environment
    - **Rationale**: Organization policy requires use of standardized technology platform
    - **Affected Requirements**: [US-REGISTER-001, US-ORDER-006, UC-CART-005]
    - **Impact**: Limits technology choices, may affect performance or functionality options
    - **Mitigation**: Optimize solution design within platform capabilities, identify platform enhancement opportunities

#### ADC-CONST-002: Business Operations Continuity  
    - **Constraint**: Minimal disruption to current business operations during implementation
    - **Rationale**: Business continuity requirements and revenue protection
    - **Affected Requirements**: [US-REGISTER-001, US-ORDER-006, UC-CART-005]
    - **Impact**: Limits deployment options, requires careful cutover planning
    - **Mitigation**: Phased rollout, parallel operations period, comprehensive rollback plans
